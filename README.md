# PhysisOS – The Operating System for a Great World

> **"Built of the people, by the people, for the people — vibrating at love’s frequency (7.83 Hz)."**

PhysisOS is Linux for human consciousness: open-source, decentralized, heart-aligned. Every human is a co-developer. No elites. No gatekeepers. Just **khalifah coding reality**.
